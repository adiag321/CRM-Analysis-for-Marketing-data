# <p align = 'center'>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Analysis for Marketing data</p>

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

I’m a Data Scientist, and the Chief Marketing Officer has told me that previous marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. I need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions.

## BRIEF

1. Performed `Data Exploration` and `Segmentation` to study the key characteristic features of `Potential customers` using Python.
2. Executed `Hypothesis Testing`, `Statistical Analysis`, `Anomaly Detection and Trend Analysis`, and `Feature Engineering` to identify sequential demand patterns and Customer Behavior.
3. Calculated the top 10 Informative features using `Random Forest Feature Importance`.
4. Detected `Successful Marketing Channels` and `Underperforming Marketing Campaigns`.
5. Designed Interactive dashboards using `Flourish` to analyze the trends, give recommendations and publish the findings.
6. Implemented a `Feature Store` to centralize, standardize, and reuse curated customer features across multiple campaigns, enabling consistent and efficient deployment of ML models.

![text](Images/important_feautres.png)

We can now see that the top 7 factors are:

1. Average order volume
2. Total amount spent in the last two years
3. Total number of purchases in the last two years
4. Amount spent on wine in the last 2 years
5. Number of purchases made using a catalog
6. Number of visits to company's web site in the last month
7. Total number of purchases through website in the last two years

However, we can’t tell whether each factor is positively or negatively correlated to the number of store purchases. We can use SHAP to explain it.

![text](Images/SHAP_1.png)

Finding:

1. The number of store purchases increases with the higher total amount spent(Total_Mnt), higher total purchase amount(Total_num_purchase), higher AOV, and higher amount of wines purchases(MntWines).
2. The number of store purchases decreases with more website visits(NumWebVisitsMonth), a higher number of purchases through the catalog(NumCatalogPurchases), and a higher number of purchases through websites(NumWebPurchases).

`Summary:` People who mostly shop at stores tend to buy more wines, have a higher average order volume, and shop less through the internet or catalog.


#### - Amount of Gold V/s Purchases

![text](Images/AOV%20vs%20NumStorePurchases.png)

As we can see, there is a very vague trend that says as MntGoldProds increases, NumStorePurchases also increases. Now, let’s look at the correlation test.

* Pearson correlation (r):  0.38326418634704296
* Pearson p-value:  3.4668974417790955e-79

We got a Pearson correlation of 0.38 and a p-value of almost zero, which states that they are statistically significant and have a positive correlation. (If the p-value is > 0.05, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis, where they do not correlate.)


#### - Amount of Omega 3 V/s Consumption by Couples who are Married and education status is PhD

![text](Images/Married%20PhD%20vs%20the%20rest.png)

This plot shows that the rest of the customers spent more on fish products as its 50th percentile is higher than the married Ph.D. group.


#### D) Data Visualization:

#### - `Successfull Marketing Campaign`

![text](Images/Which%20marketing%20campaign%20is%20most%20successful.png)

Response means the last marketing campaign, which is the most successful one. It performed nearly twice as well as the previous campaigns, except campaign 2.

#### - What does an `Average customer look like for his company?`

An average customer...

* has an annual income of 52200 dollars
* had purchased 49 days ago
* has an AOV of 26.8 dollars
* has spent 605 dollars
* has purchased 20 times
* became a customer in mid-June
* became a customer on Thursday
* spent most on wines(300 dollars) and then * meat products(165 dollars)
* spent least on fruit(26 dollars) and sweet products(27 dollars)

## FEATURE IMPORTANCE

We have computated feature importance using Recurssive Feature Elimination method (along with the best params selected for random forest regressor).

## FEATURE STORE IMPLEMENTATION

To streamline and standardize the use of engineered features across different machine learning workflows, a Feature Store was implemented using `Feast`, an open-source feature store for ML.

#### *How It Was Implemented:*
1. Data Preparation:
* Created event_timestamp and ensured each record had a unique Customer ID.
* Split the dataset into predictors and target variables.
* Saved both datasets in Parquet format for optimized storage and access.

2. Feast Initialization:
* Initialized a Feast repository using feast init.
* Defined feature views in Python to represent customer attributes and campaign responses.

3. Apply and Fetch Features:
* Used feast apply to register features with the store.
* Queried historical features for training using get_historical_features.

#### *Advantages of using Feature Store:*
* Consistency: Ensures the same feature definitions are used during training and inference, reducing data leakage and model drift.
* Reusability: Centralizes features, allowing them to be reused across different models and teams.
* Scalability: Facilitates deployment in production pipelines with minimal friction.

## CONCLUSION

`Patterns:`

1. High-Income People
— tend to spend more and purchase more.
— tend to visit the company’s website less frequently than other people.
— tend to has few numbers of purchases made with a discount

2. People having kids at home
— tend to spend less and purchase less.
— tend to has a high number of purchases made with a discount

3. People who purchased with high average order volume
— tend to buy more wines and meat products
— tend to make a high number of purchases made using a catalog
— tend not to visit the company’s website.


`Anomalies:`

1. Intuitively, I’d think the more complaints a customer has, the less they may spend on our store, but the number of complaints in the last two years has almost no correlation with the total amount spent in the last two years.

After further investigating the data, I found that it is because we only have 20 customers who complained in the last two years, but we have 2200 customers in total. So, because of the imbalanced ratio, they don’t correlate. The customer service department in the company has done a wonderful job in the last two years.
